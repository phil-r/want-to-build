> :scroll: List of projects that I want to build

This is a common problem that I come up with some cool ideas, but don't have time to build them. But when I finally have some time or my friend/colleague asks for some ideas she can build I can't think of any of the top of my head ðŸ˜­

To solve this I'll keep the list of my ideas and small descriptions of them here.

## Not started

This are the projects I haven't started working on

### EZlytics

Self-hosted analytics with server-side and simle client code and nice admin ui.

 - should allow to track pageviews and custom events (like `ga('send', 'pageview', location.pathname);`)
 - combine events into sessions
 - have a nice viewer for sessions

### YZtesting

Self-hosted AB-testing tool, that cares about your conversion. Most of the A/B testing tools(Optimizely, VWO) are really bloated and hard to use. But from developers point of view you just need to know a test you're running and what variation to show. Also without proper setup they can kill your conversions by leading to a losing variation.

Example React pseudocode:

```jsx
const test = YZ.getTest('123');
const variation = test.variation; // Can contain some data, or just a `variation.id` can be used to decide what to render

render() {
  return (
   <button
     onClick={()=>{
       // do some real stuff
       test.reportSuccess(); // test knows what variation was used
     }}
   >
     {variation.text}
   </button>
  );
}

```

### KARMA inc.

Public database of Corporations misdeeds (and virtues).

A lot of big companies were caught doing some shady business([panama papers](http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/en/), [paradise papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/), etc.) but it's quite hard to track what companies were actually involved and how bad it was. This database will aggregate all news articles about big companies(and maybe famous people) and provide overall `KARMA` score.


## Started

This are the projects that I've started but haven't finished

### To remember

Everyday photo diary. Works for just one(but very important) person right now.

### Sneak peek

App where you can exchnage photos with a stranger. You can keep this photo dialogue until somebody stops to reply.
