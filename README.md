> :scroll: List of projects that I want to build

This is a common problem that I come up with some cool ideas, but don't have time to build them. But when I finally have some time or my friend/colleague asks for some idea she can build I can't think of any of the top of my head ðŸ˜­

To solve this I'll keep the list of my ideas and small descriptions of them here.

## Not started

This are the projects I haven't started working on

### EZlytics

Self-hosted analytics with server-side and simle client code and nice admin ui. 

 - should allow to track pageviews and custom events (like `ga('send', 'pageview', location.pathname);`)
 - combine events into sessions 
 - have a nice viewer for sessions
